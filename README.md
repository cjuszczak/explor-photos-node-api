# Explor.photos

Explor.photos is my personal playground of sorts for playing with various new JavaScript frameworks to build my own personal photo gallery. This is a work in progress and generally only updated time permitting. Currently the back-end work is in progress and the front-end work will start once a sufficient amount of the back-end is available for use.
